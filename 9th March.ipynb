In other words, as the sample size increases, the distribution of sample means becomes more normal.\n",

It allows statisticians to make assumptions about the distribution of sample means, even when the distribution of the population is unknown or not normally distributed.\n",

    "   - The sampling distribution of the sample mean becomes approximately normal, regardless of the shape of the original population distribution.\n",

    "   - The mean of the sampling distribution of the sample mean is equal to the population mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Standard Deviation of Sample Means:**\n",

    "**Significance of the Central Limit Theorem:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Statistical Inference:**\n",
    "   - The Central Limit Theorem forms the basis for many statistical inference procedures, including hypothesis testing and confidence interval estimation. It allows for the use of normal distribution-based methods in situations where the distribution of the population may be unknown or not normal.\n",

    "4. **Population Distribution:**\n",
    "   - The Central Limit Theorem assumes that the shape of the population distribution from which the samples are drawn is not important, as long as the population has a finite mean and a finite standard deviation. This means that the theorem can apply even if the underlying population distribution is not normal.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Finite Population Standard Deviation:**\n",
    "   - The population standard deviation ( sigma ) should be finite. If the population standard deviation is infinite or unknown, the Central Limit Theorem may not hold.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Stationarity (for Time Series Data):**\n",
    "   - In the case of time series data, the observations should be stationary, meaning that the statistical properties of the time series do not change over time. Non-stationarity can affect the application of the Central Limit Theorem."
