    "2. **Measures of Dispersion:**\n",
    "   - **Range:**\n",
    "     - Outliers can significantly impact the range, especially if they are far from the bulk of the data.\n",
    "     - The range becomes larger when extreme values are present.\n",
    "   - **Variance and Standard Deviation:**\n",
    "     - Outliers can greatly affect variance and standard deviation, as these measures involve squared differences from the mean.\n",
    "     - The squared deviations from outliers can inflate these measures.\n",
    "   - **Interquartile Range (IQR):**\n",
    "     - The IQR is less sensitive to outliers than the range, as it is based on quartiles.\n",
    "     - It is a robust measure of spread in the presence of extreme values.\n",
