    "In Python, code blocks are used to define the structure and hierarchy of the code. Here are some of the blocks of code commonly used in Python:\n",

    "1.Function blocks: Functions are defined using the \"def\" keyword, followed by the function name and arguments, and a colon. The code inside the function is indented, and the function ends when the indentation ends.\n",

    "4.Class blocks: Classes are used to define objects with properties and methods. The \"class\" keyword is used to define the class and the code inside the class block defines the properties and methods."

    "Memory management in Python is done automatically by the Python interpreter, using a combination of techniques, including reference counting, garbage collection, and memory pooling.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Reference counting: Python uses a reference counting mechanism to keep track of the memory usage of objects. Each object in Python has a reference count, which is the number of references to that object. When an object is created, its reference count is set to 1. When the object is assigned to a variable or passed as an argument to a function, the reference count is incremented. When a variable is deleted or goes out of scope, or when a function call returns, the reference count of the object is decremented. When the reference count of an object reaches 0, the object is deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Garbage collection: Python also has a garbage collector that runs periodically to free up memory that is no longer being used by the program. The garbage collector identifies and removes objects that are no longer accessible from the program. This is done by identifying objects that have a reference count of 0 or objects that cannot be reached by any reference chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Memory pooling: Python uses a memory pool for efficient allocation and deallocation of memory. The memory pool is a pre-allocated block of memory that is used to satisfy allocation requests. When an object is deleted, its memory is returned to the memory pool for later reuse. This can reduce the overhead of memory allocation and deallocation, and improve the performance of the program."

    "\n",
    "6.To verify that Python has been installed, open the command prompt by pressing the \"Windows key + R\", type \"cmd\" and hit Enter. Then, type \"python --version\" and hit Enter. You should see the version of Python you just installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.To set the path variables, right-click on \"This PC\" and select \"Properties\". Then, click on \"Advanced system settings\" and select the \"Environment Variables\" button.\n",

    "8.Under \"System Variables\", scroll down until you find \"Path\" and click \"Edit\".\n",
    "\n",
    "9.Click \"New\" and enter the path to the folder containing the Python executable. This is typically \"C:\\Python39\" for Python 3.9, but it may be different depending on the version you installed and where you chose to install it.\n",
    "\n",
    "10.Click \"OK\" to close all the windows and save the changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "11.You can now use Python from the command prompt or any other terminal window by simply typing \"python\" and hitting Enter. If you encounter any issues, make sure to double-check that the path variables have been set correctly."
