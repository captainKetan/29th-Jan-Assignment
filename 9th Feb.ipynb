    "Getter and setter methods are used in object-oriented programming to control access to the attributes of a class. They provide a way to retrieve (`get`) and modify (`set`) the values of private attributes, allowing for more controlled access and encapsulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In below example, the `Person` class has private attributes `_name` and `_age`. Getter methods (`get_name` and `get_age`) are used to retrieve the values of these attributes, and setter methods (`set_name` and `set_age`) are used to modify these values. The use of getter and setter methods allows for controlled access to the attributes and validation if needed. Note that in Python, naming conventions are used to indicate the visibility of an attribute, and a single leading underscore (`_`) is commonly used to denote a protected attribute."

    "Method overriding in Python refers to the ability of a subclass to provide a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass. When a subclass defines a method with the same name as a method in its superclass, it overrides the behavior of that method in the superclass.\n",

The `Dog` and `Cat` classes are subclasses of `Animal` and override the `speak` method to provide their specific implementations. When an instance of `Dog` or `Cat` calls the `speak` method, it uses the overridden version defined in their respective classes. This allows for polymorphic behavior, where the same method name behaves differently based on the type of the object calling it."
