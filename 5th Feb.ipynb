    "The four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Encapsulation: The process of hiding data and implementation details within a class, so that the object's internal state cannot be modified directly by other parts of the program. Instead, the class provides a well-defined interface that allows users to interact with object's attributes in a controlled manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Abstraction: The process of creating abstract classes or interfaces that define a set of methods or properties that can be used by other classes, without revealing the underlying implementation details. Abstraction allows programmers to create complex systems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable pieces.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Inheritance: The process of creating new classes that are based on existing classes, and inherit their properties and methods. Inheritance allows programmers to reuse code and to create more specialized classes that share common functionality with their parent classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Polymorphism: The ability of objects to take on multiple forms or types, depending on the context in which they are used. Polymorphism allows programmers to write code that can work with different types of objects, without having to know their specific type at compile time. This makes code more flexible and adaptable to changing requirements."
