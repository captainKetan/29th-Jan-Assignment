    "\n",
    "### Geometric Interpretation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Eigenvectors:**\n",
    "   - **Direction Preservation:** Eigenvectors are vectors that, when multiplied by a matrix, only change in length (possibly scaled) but not in direction. The transformation described by the matrix stretches or compresses the vector along its original direction.\n",
    "   - **Transformed but Unchanged Direction:** If v is an eigenvector of matrix A with eigenvalue lambda, then Av = lambda*v. This equation signifies that the transformation A only scales the vector v by the factor lambda, leaving its direction unchanged.\n",

    "2. **Eigenvalues:**\n",
    "   - **Scaling Factor:** Eigenvalues represent the scale factors by which eigenvectors are stretched or compressed during the transformation. Each eigenvalue corresponds to a specific eigenvector.\n",
    "   - **Magnitude Change:** If the eigenvalue is greater than 1, the corresponding eigenvector is stretched. If the eigenvalue is between 0 and 1, the eigenvector is compressed. If the eigenvalue is negative, the eigenvector is also scaled but is flipped in direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a 2x2 matrix A and its eigenvectors and eigenvalues:\n",
    "\n",
    " A = [[2,1],[0,3]] \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Eigenvalues:**\n",
    "   - The characteristic equation |A - lambda*I| = 0 gives eigenvalues lambda_1 = 2 and lambda_2 = 3.\n",
    "   - These eigenvalues represent the scaling factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Eigenvectors:**\n",
    "   - For lambda_1 = 2, solving (A - 2I)v_1 = 0 gives an eigenvector v_1 = [[1],[0]].\n",
    "   - For lambda_2 = 3, solving (A - 3I)v_2 = 0 gives an eigenvector v_2 = [[1],[1]].\n",
    "\n",
    "### Geometric Interpretation in this Example:\n",

    "- **Eigenvalue 2:**\n",
    "  - The eigenvector [[1],[0]] remains unchanged in the horizontal direction and gets scaled by a factor of 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Eigenvalue 3:**\n",
    "  - The eigenvector [[1],[1]] remains unchanged along the diagonal direction and gets scaled by a factor of 3.\n",

    "   - **Role of Eigen-Decomposition:** In Kernel PCA, the eigen decomposition is performed on the kernel matrix, which captures the pairwise similarities between data points in the higher-dimensional space induced by the kernel. This allows the identification of nonlinear patterns in the data.\n",
    "   - **Applications:** Kernel PCA is applied in various machine learning tasks, including face recognition, speech analysis, and bioinformatics. It is particularly useful when dealing with datasets that exhibit nonlinear relationships among features."
